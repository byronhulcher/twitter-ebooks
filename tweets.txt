@farawaythyer game engines are a blessing and a curse ðŸ˜ž
@farawaythyer yep! You'd have to figure out how to represent that and have your game load it from there so you have a shared resource
@farawaythyer I've found game dev to be like 25% writing specialized scripts and tools to do what you want that you'll never use again
@farawaythyer nopenopenopenope write a tool that takes shitty big map + (path over time) and scripts it for you
@farawaythyer yeah this compacts it but would be more prone to error when doubling back or require you to write a packing tool
@bafeldman AUGH
@farawaythyer since direction at a time is deterministic rather than player driven from what I understand. But again, probably not needed
@farawaythyer I.E. you save your map as one long list of rows, and fill rather than lookup based on the player direction at time
@farawaythyer one optimization, which might be a couple factors more complicated than you want would be treating it as linear instead of 2D
@farawaythyer very nice! You've got the right approach for this problem

@reconbot i mean if someone wants the full code they could add the GitHub package to their package.json. This seems like a useful feature?
@reconbot we use a prepublish script and only distribution the 'dist' directory so people don't have to grab dev deps or run a postinstall
